This is a read me file
Week3
In the gallery.html in the <script></script> tags i have included my code for the slide.
I have intialzed a vaiable `slideIndex` to 1 which calles `showSlide` function with the inital index
The `ShowSlide` function gets a slide index as an argument and hides their slide element (`mySlide`) by changing the `display` propert to "none".
This then displays the slide with the given index by by changing the `display` propert to "block".
The function `plusSlides` is called by clicking the "Previous" or the "Next" buttons, and then it updates the `slideIndex` to then display the previous slide
